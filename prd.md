## 1. Objective

To build a lightweight, intuitive content management web app where users can store, categorize, and retrieve social media content (YouTube videos, Tweets, and LinkedIn posts) by pasting links.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Users come across valuable content on platforms like YouTube, Twitter (X), and LinkedIn but lose track of them over time. Traditional bookmarking tools are either too generic or donâ€™t display rich previews, metadata, or enable smart tagging. There's a need for a focused tool for curating and organizing valuable web content in one place.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

### Goals
- Allow users to save and categorize social media links.
- Display link previews (thumbnail, metadata, etc.).

### Success Metrics
- Time to save a link: < 3 seconds.
- >80% user retention after 7 days of use.
- >90% successful metadata extraction from supported platforms.
- Average session time > 3 minutes.
